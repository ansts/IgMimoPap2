# A funciton which iteratively scans the set of features and finds at each cycle the feature  
# the removal of which imrpoves most the separation between the classes of interest c, then removes it 
# leaving one less features for the next cycle. The separation is measured using a composite clustering criterion in critsel()
# consisting of the best value selected among Dunn's or BHgamma criteria as well as negative Connectivity.
# The criteria are transformed to compensate for their dependence on the dimensionality in the range of dimensions 3-600 
# and to restrict them in the range between -1 and 1. The conversion functions dunnfix, connfix and bhgamfix 
# are vectorized for faster calculations. The dimesionality standardized values obtained are converted using exponential function 
# with a base s randomly selected in the range of 1 - 1.5 and common  for all calculations in one call to this function.
# This transformation ensures the non-negativity of the criteria and adds a small random factor selecting in every call
# a slightly different profile. In this way the huge profile space is searched more efficiently in a kind of bootstrap 
# fashion and the final profile is determined by consensus of several (n=5) profiles in profileSearch().
